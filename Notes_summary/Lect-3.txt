If we check index.html file we can see that there is only one div having id root
where as same in main.jsx file we can see that we are targeting the root id and in that we are making a virtual Dom and 
rendering it.

code:
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />

 ReactDOM.createRoot is a method from the ReactDOM library that creates
 a root DOM node where the React application will be rendered. In 
 this case, it's creating a root node inside the DOM element with  
 the ID root

Render method is called on the root node created by createRoot.
 The render method takes a React element (or elements) and renders 
 it to the DOM.
