First we have seen some documentation by going react.dev official website.
React is library and it has 2 attachment: react-dom and react-native.
react-dom is used for website and react-native is used for  mobile apps.
When we have installed node with that npm has also come(npm => node package manager).
The most basic way to create a react app is to write: npx create-react-app file_name
Here npx is node package executer create-react-app is utility.
But the problem is that it take to much time because it is to heavy.

Now there are various bundles like vite that is lighter than react app
so rather than using heavy react app we will be using vite. 
delete unnecessary files: such as assest.

also install npm i : it is necessary

code in Api.jsx:
function App() {

  return (
   <h1>React learning</h1>
  )
}
export default App

now this will run on the screen through main.jsx

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
code in main.jsx:
import React from 'react' // This will import react
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App.jsx' // this will add App.jsx file


ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode> // this has a benefit but you can remove that if you want
    <App /> // This XML code that will include the App file output
  </React.StrictMode>,
)

Now in main.jsx can only handle only one tag in that you can mention multiple tags

=> <></> this is used in that  we can mention mutliple tag
